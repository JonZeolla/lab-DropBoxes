## Migrations
On 2016-12-29, this repo was migrated from the DropBoxes branch of https://github.com/JonZeolla/Lab to its own standalone repository.  This was in order to make contributions and third party use easier, as I received feedback that the branching strategy used before was confusing to some.

On 2015-09-14, this repo was migrated from [Brian W Gray's keysweeper repo](https://github.com/BrianWGray/keysweeper).
